#### Backup groups ####
#######################

## Groups are here to share the same backup options between multiple domains.
## That way, it is possible, for example, to have a different policy retention
## for a pool of guests in testing than for the one in production.

## Define default options for all groups. ##
default:
  daily: 4
  weekly: 2
  monthly: 5
  yearly: 1

## Groups definition ##
groups:
  ## Group name ##
  test:
    ## Backup directory ##
    target: /mnt/kvm/backups

    ## Compression to use for each backup:
    ##   None: images will be copied as they are
    ##   tar: images will be packaged in a tar file
    ##   xz: images will be packaged in a tar file with xz compression
    ##   gz: images will be packaged in a tar file with gzip compression
    ##   bz2: images will be packaged in a tar file with bz2 compression
    compression: xz

    ## Compression level to use for each backup:
    ## Generally this should be an integer between 1~9 (depends on the
    ## compression algorithm), where 1 will be the fastest while having
    ## the lowest compression ratio, and 9 gives the best compression ratio
    ## but takes the longest time to compress.
    compression_lvl: 6

    ## When doing `virt-backup backup` without specifying any group, only
    ## groups with the autostart option enabled will be backup.
    autostart: True

    ## Retention policy: the first backup of the day is considered as the
    ## "daily" backup, first of the week "weekly", etc. The following options
    ## detail how many backups of each type has to be kept. Set `None` for an
    ## infinite retention.
    hourly: 1
    daily: 3
    weekly: 2
    monthly: 5
    yearly: 1

    ## Hosts definition ##
    hosts:
      ## This policy will match the domain "domainname" in libvirt, and will
      ## backup the disks "vba" and "vdb" only.
      - host: domainname
        disks:
          - vda
          - vdb
      ## Will backup all disks of "domainname2" ##
      - domainname2
      ## Regex that will match for all domains starting with "prod". The regex
      ## syntax is the same as the python one
      - "r:^prod.*"
      ## Exclude the domain domainname3 (useful with regex, for example)
      - "!domainname3"
      ## Exclude all domains starting with "test"
      - "!r:^test.*"
